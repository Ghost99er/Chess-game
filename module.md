## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (4)?

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write a simple game using any game framework such as PyGame, Arcade (Python), Unity, or GoDot. You can also create your own by using graphics packages like OpenGL or Raylib.

The game must have the following characteristics:

The game must display graphics

The game must take user input from the keyboard or mouse

The game must have moveable objects

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Allow the user to save and load the game.

Add music or sound effects to the game.

Provide levels in your game that change the difficulty of the game.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

Official PyGame Documentation: The official documentation provides comprehensive guides and tutorials to understand the basics and advanced features of PyGame.
Link: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition by Eric Matthes: This book has a section on creating games with PyGame, which is beginner-friendly and provides a structured approach.
YouTube Tutorials: Channels like "Clear Code" and "Tech With Tim" offer step-by-step PyGame tutorials.
Clear Code: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClearCode
Tech With Tim: https://www.youtube.com/techwithtim

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

 Set up the development environment and read through basic PyGame documentation.
Follow beginner tutorials to understand the game loop, event handling, and drawing basics.
Implement a simple static game screen with background and a basic grid layout for the chessboard.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

Chess Game: Design a two-player Chess game, featuring standard chess rules and gameplay.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

Days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Times: 12 PM - 10 PM
Locations: Home 

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?


Technical Risk: Difficulty in implementing advanced chess mechanics and AI.

Mitigation Plan: Start with basic mechanics and incrementally add advanced features. Use online resources and forums for troubleshooting and advice.
Behavioral Risk: Procrastination or inconsistent work schedule.

Mitigation Plan: Set specific goals for each work session and adhere to the schedule. Use productivity tools like timers and task lists to stay focused and track progress.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
